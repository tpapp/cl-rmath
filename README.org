#+TITLE: A simple wrapper for libRmath

This is a simple, autogenerated foreign interface for the standalone [[http://www.r-project.org][R]] API
[[
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#The-R-API][libRmath]].  There has been no effort to provide a high-level interface for the original library, instead, this library is meant to serve as a building block for such an interface.

The =libRmath= shared library has to be installed for this library to work.  For example, on Debian/Ubuntu/..., you just need to
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
apt-get install r-mathlib
#+END_EXAMPLE
as root.

The function names are preserved as they are.  Packages should not use the =cl-rmath= package, but refer to symbols using the =cl-rmath= or =rmath= package qualifiers (in fact, =fround= is in both =cl= and =cl-rmath=, so useing the package would require shadowing).

Functions using random number generators are not expected to work out of the box.

It is only necessary to run =make= when =Rmath.h= changes.

Bugs and issues should be reported using the Github issue tracker.
